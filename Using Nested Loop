'''write a python prog to display available colours and sizes of the products in e-commerce application using nested loop concept
the business requirements:
1. create a list of colors like red, blue, green
2.create a list to hold sizes like small , medium, large
3. use neste d loops to generate all the possible combinations of colors associated with sizes for user to select appropriate product.'''
